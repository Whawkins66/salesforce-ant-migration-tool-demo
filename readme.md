# Salesforce Build Automation Demos

##### Every modern software project requires build automation and Continuous Integration. In this repository I'm trying to collect most interesting topics around Salesforce project build automation

Continuous Integration and build automation are key features which allow you to feel safe during Production deployments. Setting up a CI is a first thing which you have to do when you're starting a new project or when you came in to a project without CI.  

The project has the following structure:

  - ###### ant-migration-tool
    Official documentation and .jar for 28-39 versions of Ant migration tool
  - ###### beginners-demo
    Most simple example of using Ant migration tool for Salesforce project
  - ###### standard-build
    Demo of most standard build scripts
  - ###### advanced-examples
    Examples of building Salesforce environment with different steps and many scripts in different languages
